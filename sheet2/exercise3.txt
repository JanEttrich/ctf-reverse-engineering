To prevent buffer overflows, boundary checks of buffers should always be performed before writing
data into them. This can be archieved by using safe functions like fgets() or strncpy(), which use
a parameter "size" for restricting the number of bytes written into a buffer.
Unsafe functions like gets() should be avoided.
Additionally, the stack can be protected by using stack canaries, which serve as guards to the
function return pointer. If the return pointer is overwritten, the canary is overwritten as well
due to the stack layout, so overflows can be detected
